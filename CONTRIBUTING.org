Thank you very much for your willingness to contribute to =emacs-plus= project!
Please make sure that you are familiar with the following rules.

1. Every contribution is welcomed (even README fixes).
2. This is not the place to complain about Emacs issues. It's highly unlikely
   that they will be addressed here, so it's better to report them upstream.
3. We are open to many patches (even rejected by upstream), but not all. For two
   reasons:
   1. If it fixes the bug in upstream, it's better to address it there when it's
      possible.
   2. If it adds new build flag, then it increases the build matrix, which is
      unwanted.
4. If you wish to include the patch, add it to this repository under =patches=
   directory. In order to specify the proper URL for this patch, use
   =PatchUrlResolver.url= helper.
