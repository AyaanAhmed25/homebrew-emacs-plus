* Emacs Plus

Emacs Plus is GNU Emacs formulae based on =emacs= [[https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/emacs.rb][formulae]]. The difference is
that some of the options available from =emacs= formulae are enabled by default
in =emacs-plus= and some new [[#options][additional options]] are available for user.

** Install

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
$ brew install emacs-plus [options]
#+END_SRC

** Options

To get list of all available options, call ~brew info emacs-plus~. Here is
relevant part from output of that command for your convenience.

Note that by default =emacs-plus= is builds Cocoa version of Emacs with
=gnutls=, =imagemagick=, =librsvg= and dynamic modules support by default. Also
it changes default GNU Emacs icon to Spacemacs icon. If you wish to change
defaults, just use =--without-FEATURE= flag.
